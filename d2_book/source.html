    <h1>Fundamentals of Data Engineering</h1>

    <p>Data engineering has grown rapidly in the past decade, leaving many software engineers, data scientists, and
        analysts
        looking for a comprehensive view of this practice. With this practical book, you'll learn how to plan and build
        systems
        to serve the needs of your organization and customers by evaluating the best technologies available through the
        framework of the data engineering lifecycle.

        Authors Joe Reis and Matt Housley walk you through the data engineering lifecycle and show you how to stitch
        together a
        variety of cloud technologies to serve the needs of downstream data consumers. You'll understand how to apply
        the
        concepts of data generation, ingestion, orchestration, transformation, storage, and governance that are critical
        in any
        data environment regardless of the underlying technology.</p>

    <p>This book will help you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Get a concise overview of the entire data engineering landscape</li>
        <li>Assess data engineering problems using an end-to-end framework of best practices</li>
        <li>Cut through marketing hype when choosing data technologies, architecture, and processes</li>
        <li>Use the data engineering lifecycle to design and build a robust architecture</li>
        <li>Incorporate data governance and security across the data engineering lifecycle</li>
